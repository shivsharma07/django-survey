# Internationalization #
A detailled page explaining how to intrnationalized a django application can be found there : http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/i18n/ you can also find some information in the django book : http://www.djangobook.com/en/1.0/chapter18/
You will find below the main commands I make the assumption that `django-admin.py` is in your PATH.

## Directory structure ##
You will find bellow the subset of the `django-survey` that is related to the internationalization. In our case the reusable web application is `survey`, that is what you probably want to reuse in your project. We are providing it bundle with an example of project called : `examples`. Note that the locale directory is in `survey` not `examples`.
```
|-- django-survey.kpf
|-- examples
|   |-- settings.py
|-- survey
|   |-- locale
|   |   |-- en
|   |   |   `-- LC_MESSAGES
|   |   |       |-- django.mo
|   |   |       `-- django.po
|   |   `-- fr
|   |       `-- LC_MESSAGES
|   |           |-- django.mo
|   |           `-- django.po
```
## Adding a new language ##
```
survey$ django-admin.py makemessages -l <LANGUAGE_CODE>
processing language <LANGUAGE_CODE>
```
This command creates the message file for the new language. It should be run from `survey` directory. It creates a folder there :  `survey/locale/<LANGUAGE_CODE>/LC_MESSAGES/django.po` where 

<LANGUAGE\_CODE>

 can be : en, fr,de, ...


## Updating the message files ##
```
survey$ django-admin.py makemessages -a
processing language fr
processing language en
```
In the example above the system has updated the fr (French) and en (English) message files. This command should be run each time you had a string that needs to be translated.

## Compiling the messages ##
```
examples$ manage.py compilemessages
```
Each time you make a modification to a file containing the messages `.po`, youâ€™ll need to compile them into a more efficient form, for use by gettext, this is done by using `manage.py compilemessages`. Before running this command you need to be sure that you have defined the environment variable : `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` else you can explicately specify the Python path to settings module.
